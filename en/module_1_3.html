          </div>
            <h2>Module Description</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this module is to present causes and consequences of information pollution, in order to increase the awareness of learners regarding the motivation behind the creation of information pollution as well as its possible impacts.</p>
            <p class="trainer">The secondary aim is to guide trainers who want to use the content of this Module to train their learners.</p>
            <p class="trainer">With these aims in this module, motivations behind creating and spreading false or misleading information and its effect on public and democracies along with guidelines about how to teach the subject are covered.</p>
            <p>Learners who successfully complete this module will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>demonstrate an understanding of the intend and motivation behind the information pollution</li>
              <li>demonstrate an understanding of the consequences of information pollution</li>
              <li>demonstrate an understanding of one’s responsibility in the fight against information pollution</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="trainer">Additionally, trainers who successfully complete this module, will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the guidelines for training on the subject.</p>

            <span class="trainer">
            <h3>Getting Prepared</h3>
            <p>Preparing a presentation (PowerPoint/Prezi/Canva) which is enriched with visual materials (images and video clips) and clear solid examples is strongly suggested. Choosing and presenting local examples (country specific) from the current or well known cases with clear motivations and well known consequences are also suggested. The more familiar and popular the examples are, the better the message will be  communicated. Local (national) news media and fact checking platforms could be a good source for a wide range of information pollution case studies, real life consequences of which have already been published and elaborated in detail.</p>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>A short quiz (3 to 5 questions) in Kahoot or questions with Mentimeter can be used at the beginning for engaging participants in the topic. It can be used as a motivation tool as well as a tool to check trainees’ existing knowledge about the subject.</p>
            <h3>Methods to Use</h3>
            <p>Various teaching methods can be used in combination during the training. Such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Lecturing</li>
            <li>Discussion</li>
            <li>Group work</li>
            <li>Self reflection</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Tips for Trainers</h3>
            <h4>Warming-up</h4>
            <p>An effective way of involving participants and setting common expectations about what they will learn is to ask a few preliminary questions on the subject. For instance you can ask learners</p>
            <ul>
            <li>who spreads false information</li>
            <li>why people spread false information</li>
            <li>to give an example of serious consequences of a disinformation they came across</li>
            <li>whether they ever shared false information. If yes, what was their intention and motivation?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the discussions make sure that learners are able to understand the intent of and distinguish the main motivation behind the creation and dissemination of false and misleading information. Learners should also understand that information pollution always has some consequences and people who create and/or spread dis/mis information are responsible for its consequences.</p>
            <h4>Presenting the Objective of the Lesson</h4>
            <p>The objective of the lesson should be made clear (which is to inform about the cause and consequences of information pollution). Following the warming-up questions it will be easier to clarify the objectives.</p>
            <h4>Presenting the Lesson Content</h4>
            <p>While presenting the content make sure to interact with the learners and encourage them for active participation.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Before providing an overview of motivations behind information pollution, ask participants to elaborate on possible causes.</li>
            <li>When providing examples choose real world examples and get as much background information as possible about that specific case you are presenting. So that if asked by learners/participants you can provide details.</li>
            <li>When you choose examples, make sure that motivations and consequences are either known or can be clearly identified. In some cases main motivation could be blurred.</li>
            <li>Provide some examples of disinformation (if not real world examples you can write some scenarios) with details and ask participants to elaborate on the intention and possible motivation behind them.</li>
            <li>Provide some examples of disinformation (if not real world examples you can write some scenarios) with details and ask participants to elaborate on possible effects (consequences).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Concluding</h4>
            <p>Make a short summary of the lesson and ask a couple of questions which underline the most important messages you try to give.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ask learners to describe a piece of information they have encountered which at first appeared to be harmless, but later turned out to cause serious problems</li>
            <li>Ask learners why it is important to distinguish between reliable and misleading information? (Especially in the context of politics and public health)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the discussions make sure that learners are able to understand the main motivations behind spreading dis/mis-information and their consequences. Learners should also understand that the level of harm false information may cause might vary however everyone who shares it is responsible for the consequences.</p>

            <h2>Content: Causes and Consequences of Information Pollution</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Understanding the intent and motivation behind information pollution is important to be able to combat it. There are different intentions and various motivations behind the production and dissemination of false or misleading content. For instance, as mentioned in Module 2, disinformation (false content) and malinformation (genuine) are shared intentionally to cause harm (financial, reputational, political or even physical), while misinformation (false content) mean no harm but can cause harm unintentionally (<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/Verification-Handbook-3.pdf">Wardle</a>, 2020). Whether intentional or not, information pollution always has some consequences.</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Motivation</h3>
            <p>There are four main motivations for creating false and misleading content:&nbsp; The first one is ideological (mainly political). False or misleading content is used for propaganda, persuasion, distraction and/or provocation. Driving force here is mainly to shape and influence public opinion and promote particular ideas, ideology, party or people (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf">Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017</a>, p. 217; <a target="_blank" href="https://literariness.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Literariness.org-Nicole-A.-Cooke-Fake-News-and-Alternative-Facts_-Information-Literacy-in-a-Post-Truth-Era-ALA-Editions-2018.pdf">Cooke, 2018</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/Verification-Handbook-3.pdf">Wardle, 2020</a>). The second one is financial. It is possible to make money from advertising on a web site through a sensational or false article, headline or image. Here clicks are driven to make revenue. False or biased content is also produced to promote particular products or services while sometimes discrediting others (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf">Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017</a>, p. 217; <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/Verification-Handbook-3.pdf">Wardle, 2020</a>). The third one is social and/or psychological. Some people are motivated simply by the desire to cause trouble. They would like to see whether they can fool journalists or provocate people. Others end up sharing misinformation to present a particular identity (<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/Verification-Handbook-3.pdf">Wardle, 2020</a>). A need to be liked, for instant gratification and attention on social media, are among psychological motivations (<a target="_blank" href="https://literariness.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Literariness.org-Nicole-A.-Cooke-Fake-News-and-Alternative-Facts_-Information-Literacy-in-a-Post-Truth-Era-ALA-Editions-2018.pdf">Cooke, 2018</a>). The last one, as in the case of satire and parody, is entertainment and humor.</p>
            <p>The false content is created with different intentions and motivations. What is making them more damaging is the dissemination. If false content weren&rsquo;t shared and reached mass audiences, they would do less harm (<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/Verification-Handbook-3.pdf">Wardle, 2020</a>).</p>
            <h3>Consequences of Information Pollution</h3>
            <p>False news stories are pervasive on the Internet and have the potential to mislead people around the world. A 2016 survey found that &ldquo;fake news headlines fool American adults about 75 percent of the time (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/fake-news-survey">Silverman &amp; Singer-Vine 2016</a>). In some cases, people ignore the fake news they come across, but in some cases people believe them and fake news leads to concrete actions and serious consequences such as affecting election results, harming democracies, discrediting individuals, nations, businesses and/or causing panic (<a target="_blank" href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4948550/mod_resource/content/1/Fake%20News%20Digital%20Journalism%20-%20Tandoc.pdf">Tandoc, 2018</a>, p. 137).</p>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <div class="well">
              <h4>Example 1: Martian Invasion</h4>
              <p>A well-known example of widespread misinformation dates back to the 1930s, when a mass panic sparked by Orson<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs0K4ApWl4g"> Welles&rsquo;s &ldquo;War of the Worlds&rdquo; broadcast</a>. Orson Welles narrated the story of Martian invasion in a radio news format with actors playing the roles of reporters, residents, experts, and government officials. While the intention was purely production of a radio drama, listeners interpreted it as factual news (<a target="_blank" href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4948550/mod_resource/content/1/Fake%20News%20Digital%20Journalism%20-%20Tandoc.pdf">Tandoc, 2018</a>, p. 138).</p>

              <h4>Example 2: Brexit Referendum</h4>
              <p>The results of the Brexit referendum in UK, the 2016 presidential election in US, Le Pen reaching the run-off vote in the French election and the overturning of the Kenyan election are some examples of the potential power of systematic disinformation campaigns, although, empirical data about the exact influence of such campaigns does not exist (<a target="_blank" href="https://rm.coe.int/information-disorder-toward-an-interdisciplinary-framework-for-researc/168076277c">Wardle &amp; Derakhshan, 2017</a>, p. 14).</p>
              <p>In the case of the Brexit referendum, the Brexit-supporting press provided invaluable back-up with a stream of negative stories (mostly false) around the migrants and economic burden EU membership causes. The campaign on immigration by politicians and the press claimed that up to five million more EU migrants could come to Britain by 2030 because 88 million people would be granted the right to live and work in the UK under EU plans to allow Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey to join it. The ultimate piece of fake news was the claim that leaving the EU would provide a &pound;350m-a-week bonus for the National Health System from the UK&rsquo;s contribution to EU coffers (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/michael-gove-boris-johnson-brexit-eurosceptic-press-theresa-may-a7533806.html">Grice, January 18, 2017</a>).</p>

              <h4>Example 3: Denial of Climate Change</h4>
              <p>Over the last four decades, a highly organised, well-funded campaign powered mainly by the fossil fuel industry has sought to discredit the science that links global climate change to human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These disinformation efforts have caused confusion over data, questioned the integrity of climate scientists and denied the scientific consensus on the role of humans (<a target="_blank" href="https://thedailyblog.co.nz/2014/02/26/investigating-climate-change-deniers-and-their-spin-against-global-warming/">Renowden, February 26, 2014</a>). Research findings prove that this public misconception about climate change led to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175799">Cook, Lewandowsky &amp; Ecker, 2017</a>).</p>

              <p>On January 6, 2020, as public officials met to certify Joe Biden&rsquo;s victory in the Presidential Election, supporters of Donald Trump, who were united around a common falsehood: The election had been unlawfully stolen from Trump, stormed the capitol by mob, resulting in a riot that left five people dead (<a target="_blank" href="https://ischool.syr.edu/when-fake-news-turns-into-conspiracy-theories-the-viral-factor-in-todays-media-landscape-and-what-we-can-do-to-stop-it/">Hemsley, 2021</a>).

              <h4>Example 9: Death Threats for Health Officials</h4>
              <p>Conspiracy theories ripped through the internet during Covid-19 outbreak endangering lives. Non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories (e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G, being manufactured in laboratory) began as soon as the pandemic hit. False claims about 5G technology inspired arson attacks on phone masts and assaults on telecommunications workers. Mass poisonings and overdoses of hydroxychloroquine - a drug that world leaders like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed cures or prevents Covid-19 were catalogued (Spring, December 26, 2020).</p>
               <p>Around the world, health officials have received death threats after issuing measures for dealing with the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert, received death threats because of his advice for social distancing measures, expanded testing, and contact tracing, among other efforts to quell the spread of the coronavirus in the US. In Australia, Queensland's chief health officer, Jeannette Young also faced threats. Young had police stationed outside her house after she closed Queensland borders with neighbouring states. In Germany, experts like Karl Lauterbach and Christian Drosten received death threats after the country imposed a shutdown and closed schools in the spring. Dozens of public health officials either quit, left, or retired from their positions since the pandemic began in January 2020 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/health-officials-worldwide-receive-death-threats-for-covid-19-response-2020-9">Al-Arshani, September 15, 2020</a>).</p>

              <h4>Example 10: Coronavirus Denial by an Influencer</h4>
              <p>Newly-emerged influencers gained huge online followings by promoting baseless claims about the pandemic. Kate Shemirani, leader of Britain's conspiracy community, has collected tens of thousands of followers with false claims - including denying coronavirus exists, blaming the symptoms of Covid-19 on 5G radio waves. She's spoken to crowds of thousands at protests in London. Her son <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XApmF1U9nJk">Sebastian Shemirani got in touch with BBC</a> because of his fears about his mother's impact on public health (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-55355911">Spring, December 26, 2020</a>).</p>
